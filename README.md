# Vue.js 3/TypeScript 4 Demo App

This shopping demo app is modified from the example in <i>[Essential Typescript](https://github.com/Apress/essential-typescript-4)</i> by Adam Freeman, without the web service data functionality (data is hard-coded and it won't send out shooping orders).

The live version of this app: https://essential-typescript-vueapp-demo.vercel.app/.

If you want to run this on your machine, download it and run ```npm install``` first (Node.js is required).

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

And open ```http://localhost:8080``` in your browser.

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

To run the production app:

```
node server.js 8080
```

And open ```http://localhost:8080``` in your browser.
